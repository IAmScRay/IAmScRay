### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is **Paul**, but in my language (*Ukrainian if to be exact*) it is pronounced "Pavlo". I am a 22 years old blockchain enthusiast & part-time Web developer, and I consider myself Senior Python Developer from Kyiv, Ukraine.

Some of my childhood experiences include ``PHP``, ``Java``, ``C`` (damn that's rough for a 10-year old...), and I started my programming journey with developing modifications & extensions for Minecraft game servers (mostly with Java and PHP).

My web development stack includes basic stuff like ``HTML``, ``CSS``, ``JS``, some ``Node.js`` and ``jQuery``.

I think I am proficient in Python based on my pet-projects, released programs and some external evaluations. I am able to:

- create sophisticated Telegram bots (blockchain-related or else)
- create a GUI using ``Tkinter`` & ``Pillow`` libraries
- use various networking libraries like ``requests`` or ``aiohttp`` for (a)synchronous HTTP requests
- use libraries for creating web servers & processing ``JSON``-requests & returning appropriate responses
- ... and much more â€“ give me some sources / docs, and I'll crack the codeðŸ˜‰
