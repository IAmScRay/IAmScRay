### Hi there 👋

My name is **Paul**, but in my language (*Ukrainian if to be exact*) it is pronounced "Pavlo". I am a 24 years old blockchain enthusiast.

Languages I use:
- Python (back-end logic with `FastAPI`, TG bots with `aiogram`, UI with `tkinter`, personal pet projects)
- Bash (server automation)
- JavaScript (native front-end development or using frameworks like `ReactJS`)
- Vyper & Solidity (smart contracts development for EVM-based chains)
